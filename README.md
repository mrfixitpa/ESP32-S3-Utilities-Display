# ESP32-S3-Utilities-Display
A dedicated Home Assistant companion display for real-time and monthly household utility usage. Built on ESPHome for the ESP32-S3-Box-3, this project replaces voice assistant features with a clean, e-ink-style dashboard that shows electricity, gas, and water consumption in a simple, always-readable format.
